# Expressions Tests

### Scope

The tests in this file verify that the interpreter analyzes expressions correctly (and provides the correct error messages when needed). This includes testing that each operator works as expected individually (unit tests) as well as testing that operators can be combined with the correct precedence and associativity (integration tests).
